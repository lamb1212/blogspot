First real post! 
Plan is to keep the same knd of formatting I use in my obsidian vault.
Meaning no real sentence structure, puncation will not be a concern and may even be off loaded to ai to do it for me.
I say that meaning...This is the blogspot...There are no rules of how I would like this to be seen 
Or at least not at this moment.

From staying up last night simply because grilling for the fam did not go as I had imagined.
I still got myself up and ready for work at 3 this morning and went about the day as per usual.
Had a few instances of falling asleep at bad times I'll admint.
And i also must admit to not keeping myself to a better sleep schedule after falling off recently....

A fair bit all over the places with my thoughts right now and how I went about the day...And that's cool.
Had a very strong conversation with Self before eating breakfast this morning. 
Admitted to myself that I felt like I dropped the ball so badly that I could'nt even go and talk to God.
To look back and see that i cried at the time and had another instance of crying from seeing an older gentelman going thru his healing process and seeing the real side to that for another person. 
That video really made me shed some tears after work today, like damn someone else really does know what that feels like.
I am not just hearing about it thru a story or experience they share. 
Something about the pictures and slides explaining the process he was going thru. Cant help but think to shed a tear like damn again....

Off topic since I am running low on time....
Randomly got the idea to boot up the thinkpad I've had loaded with kali for quite some time now and get the beast updated.
Took a few more commands than expected but to be honest I did not consider the system being outdated.
That said got 'er up and running and been messing around on it since I woke up from the nap after work. 
Pretty neat device the L490.
Nothing really to say about the system other than I am glad i decided to pick it up when I did and upgrade the RAM at the same time.
This thing got my thru CCNA 1 and 2 and about to be 3.
Just neat to have a device I have already spent time setting up with a sort of rice.

That said I do believe it is time to call this to a close....
