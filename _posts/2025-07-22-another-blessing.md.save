Howdy to the ether once again!
Now that this blog is set up I sit back and ask myself what is it that i am trying to accomplish?
To journal my inner thoughts and actually post them raw?
Most likely not however, a detailed take on a topic? That is more worthwhile...
I say that and still have the inclination to just write whatever comes to mind.
As if I do not already do that.
Only real thing on my mind as of right now is the fact that i have not tinkered with tech for a few days.
I'm still stuck on the fact that this server is able to stay up and not needing to be messed with.
Along with getting this thinkpad loaded back up. But yet again i ask for what?
I'm certain it is time for me to quit the tinker process with setting up the server.
Can't beleive here we are again pushing off the next step.....
Unsure of what it is i really do see myself doing in the line of tech, however FIND SOMETING!
