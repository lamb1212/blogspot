Howdy! It has been a quiet few weeks on the server, which is actually great news! No real issues with connectivity or reboots if and when power goes out. Quite the accomplishment after spending too much time some nights troubleshooting, knowing I have work the next day. That said, the newest update or service added to Cranberri would be that we now host our very own music library! This is something that has been in mind for quite some time with the price of music streaming and not being able to “own” said music. While I will miss one thing specifically (Soulection radio station), Apple Music has held many of us hostage simply based on “convenience.” I understand this, and for most people, it does not matter. However, for someone like myself, just not wanting to spend money monthly for something I may or may not use, this is right up my alley.

I found a P2P sharing site (which will remain unnamed) to source music from my Apple Music Library and download it through P2P, storing it on a separate laptop (Strawberri). While I was excited to get a few albums downloaded and playing locally, I recalled a video I was watching about Navidrome and streaming your music from your server. So I first had to figure out how to get all the music from Strawberri over to Cranberri. I had two options: Rsync or SCP. I went with SCP to start, as I did not know the difference at the time. SCP got the files transferred over to the server, and the next step was spinning up a Docker container with Navidrome and setting it to persistent. I logged in to the web UI and pointed my Music directory towards it. Next, I got a music player that could connect to the server on my phone and signed into that as well. Boom — we now have Apple Music at home!

After going to bed (since this took quite some time after work one day), I came back and sourced some more music. This time I decided to use Rsync, as instead of uploading albums only, I needed to ensure I was just sending files that were not detected on the server. Rsync helped with that, and while it took a few extra minutes to transfer over, it was worth it. This time I was simply updating the library and, after fixing a few issues (album art being reused on different albums and cleaning the files up), I have really finished setting up a music library. The only thing needed now is to add music and update the server when needed.

That is about it for any kind of updates server-wise. Mainly, I have been able to connect from outside the home network and utilize either SSH to interact with the server or do some nano writing. While it has not been exactly what I imagined maintaining a server would be, this is quite a fun hobby! Strange to admit this is an actual hobby alongside being an area for learning and experimentation. That’s pretty much it for this one — I plan to be more in-depth with what I update or install in the next post.
