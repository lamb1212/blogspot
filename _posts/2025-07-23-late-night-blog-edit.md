Log Update — Blogsite & GitHub Pages (Night Session)

Howdy in the early yonder!


### Log Update — Blogsite & GitHub Pages (Night Session)

- Reviewed blog post file formatting and front matter to ensure correct date and metadata
    
- Diagnosed issues with posts not showing due to incorrect filename date or front matter
    
- Fixed broken URLs caused by mismatched post filenames and permalink structures
    
- Experimented with themes: attempted switching from `minima` to `midnight` to enable dark mode
    
- Encountered GitHub Pages build failures due to unsupported plugins and config changes
    
- Reverted to stable theme (`minima`) after failed build attempts, but site still had issues
    
- Investigated duplicate site titles showing on the homepage; confirmed it was related to `README.md` and `index.md` content overlap
    
- Learned the importance of correct index page setup and minimal front matter for homepage content
    
- Familiarized with lazygit for commit and push operations; handled diverged branches and key-based authentication errors
    
- Tested draft status in front matter; confirmed draft: false posts appear live
    
- Realized that local Jekyll serve helps to preview changes before pushing to remote
    
- Overall made solid progress in understanding Jekyll/GitHub Pages interplay, site structure, and troubleshooting build issues
