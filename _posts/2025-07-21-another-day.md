Howdy to the ether!
Here's to making it this far with the blessing given from the one above.
Speaking of which this post is not really dedicated towards anything specific.
I'd say I would like to speak about things without being too much of a nuisance to others in my life.

Over the past few days I've been trying to pick up the journaling habit I've fallen off on here recently.
I'd say it was a success noting down thoughts thru the day.
Also in doing so it is not the same as it once was.
I say this in good light.

Unsure what to really write about I must admit, and that is perfectly okay.
Im almost witholding how I felt about going thru the day as if it were a tough or troublesome day.
I find it so strange that it's a "struggle" to simply speak to others. 
Not that I can't but often don't push myself out of the usual habit of keeping to self while at work.
Almost cannot stand the fact that I go back and forth with this particualr issue.
I would say the time I was working both jobs and going to school just for that one course,
that I lost bits of myself by being so invested in my direction without really having a plan one
and being so in my head about how I am percieved.

Blah Blah lets talk about sum else!
You know being in this culture of constant consumerism, was really thinking about getting a mini pc for the homelab.
What purpose would that serve? No clue honestly.
Would it be cool to set up? Prolly!
Not a needed thing though as anything I could want to do on the mini pc I could do on my server.
